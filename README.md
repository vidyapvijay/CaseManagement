A Workbook (like an Excel workbook) to view HPCC data files and apply simple data manipulation

## Requirements

For development, you will only need TypeScript, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [MYSQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) installed on your environment.


### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install & now include [NPM](https://npmjs.org/).
You should be able to run the following command after the installation procedure

Install TypeScript using the command 
	pm2 install typescript

Execute myql script located in folder HPCCInfo/server/HPCCInfo_schema.sql
